# Science Fair
 This is a little program that I made from scratch in Java. This year for the science fair, I will be testing the effects of image file format on file size and quality. I was planning on using paint dot net to export my images, however I would not be able to accurately measure the time taken to export. This is where Java comes in. It's API has an entire package dedicated to reading and writing images! And with getting the current time before and after exporting, I can easily calculate the time taken to export.
